# ACM
ACM Programming Language
This is a programming language inspired by Lisp, implemented using the C programming language. It provides a simplified Lisp-like syntax and semantics, aiming to make it easier for C programmers to incorporate Lisp-like features into their projects. This README serves as a guide to understanding and using the Language.
#Features
*Lisp-like Syntax: MPC Lisp adopts many syntax elements from Lisp, including prefix notation and parentheses for function calls.
*S-Expressions: The language is based on S-expressions, which are used for both code and data representation.
*Basic Lisp Functions: Provides a set of basic Lisp-like functions for arithmetic, list manipulation, and control flow.
*Extensibility: Users can extend the language by defining new functions and macros in C.
