ACM Programming Language
This is a programming language inspired by Lisp, implemented using the C programming language. It provides a simplified Lisp-like syntax and semantics, aiming to make it easier for C programmers to incorporate Lisp-like features into their projects. This README serves as a guide to understanding and using the Language.
